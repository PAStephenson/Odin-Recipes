## Project Aim
The aim of [this project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) was to create
a simple website comprised of a homepage and three other pages, each containing a recipe. The
homepage needed to contain a short description of the site and links to all the other pages.
Each of the recipe pages needed to contain a picture of what was being made as well as full
instructions on how to make it. 

## What I Learnt
Completing this project allowed me to practice: working with Git and GitHub, creating simple
HTML elements such as paragraphs, linking HTML pages together and adding images to web pages.
